# Kotlin extensions

This is a little collection of Kotlin extensions I find useful when developing Android app projects. Some of these are my own creation. Others are taken from various open-sourced projects, blog posts and articles across the web.

This isnt intended to be a usable library for you android app project but instead, a place for ideas that you can to look through and copy/paste what you want. ðŸ˜„
